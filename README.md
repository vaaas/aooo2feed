# Enables tracking and aggregating of AO3 searches

- adds "[track search]" in search results
- adds "Tracked Searches" module in the index page.
- when the index or a search page is opened, checks for updates

## Known bugs

- having multiple indices open simultaneously can lead to data loss
- data is stored in localstorage, so no sync across devices

## Potential improvements

- add some way to list tracked searches
- notifications?
